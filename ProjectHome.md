# ASRS - Adaptive Swarm Robots Simulation #

---


## Overview ##

The ASRS was created and designed in a graduation project for the Computer Engineering course at CUFSA - Faculdade de Engenharia Engenheiro Celso Daniel located at Santo Andre, SP, Brazil.
The project's main objective is to develop a component embedding computational swarm adaptive capabilities for behavioral control and decision taking, that can be used together with real robots and its simulation as well.
In the first stage, the component is going to be used together with a simulation program. In later steps, tests using real robots will take place.


## Tools ##

Some tools and libraries are being used in order to make the development better and faster.

### [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) ###
A very portable and simple open source library that creates a relational database that can be used embedded in almost any application.

### [SwarmRobot.org](http://www.swarmrobot.org/) ###
An open source project for a swarm micro robot platform.
All the information about the robot are open source (hardware, software and simulation).

### [Breve Simulation Environment](http://www.spiderland.org/breve/) ###
A 3D open source simulation environment for multi-agent systems.
