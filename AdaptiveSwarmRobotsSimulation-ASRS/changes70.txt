Version 4.1:

1. Chaged "TimeroutStart" -> "TimerStart"
2. New method "TimerStop"
3. Introduced software interuption in TimerStart into statePlan 14
4. Energy consumption changed: when a robot moves it consumes more energy (factor 10)
5. New constant ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_PER_TURN
6. Energetic deatch of robots: death robots are white, critical energy robots - red
7. S2Value is introduced
8. statusPlan15 is introduced 

Version 5.0:

1. Escape of the robot in corners improved.
2. New class for lights. Now it is possible to add several lights. Each light produces between 0 to 100 "light units". 
   Each robot can receive light from different lights. All contributions are added.
3. Light sensor is an Abstract class instead of Mobile class. It improves the global execution velocity.
4. Communication range has been improved.
5. GetColor method for getting the color of the nearest object.
6. Documentation updated.
